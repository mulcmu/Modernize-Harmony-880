# Alpha PCB
Kicad files for the alpha PCB.  Overall dimensions were okay.  The sides by the LCD might need trimmed down a smidge but there isn't much room for the button contacts.

Two layer PCB to keep cost down.  I ordered a 1.6mm thick but the stock board was 0.8mm so the case wouldn't snap shut properly.
